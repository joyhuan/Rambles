While I try to keep spirits high for most of the time, I still at times feel daunted by the infinite unknown (which keeps expanding) and feel ashamed by my weakness. I was delighted in September cause I kept git commits for half year and have improved a lot. However, I'm upset in October cause I'm still a novice. Such emotional roller coaster is fine, in fact, is inevitable. But whatever...
