# 无涯

While I try to keep spirits high for most of the time, I still at times feel daunted by the inifinte unknown(which keeps expanding) and feel ashamed by my weak foundation. I was delighted in Sep cause I kept git commits for half year and improved a lot. However, I'm upset in Oct cause I'm still such a novice. Such emotional roller coaster is fine, in fact, is inevitable. But whatever...
